<p>Hello and welcome to this site. </p>

<p> My name is Charles and I happen to be the creator of this website you are currently on. I am a student at the St Sebastian's School located in Needham, Massachusetts. When you can't find me in the library or the hockey rink, look in the Innovation Lab. Maybe I'm there; otherwise, I'm at home geeking out over some weird thing on the internet. Did I mention I like engineering? I am currently the President of the Engineering Club at my school and show my dominance by taking on wacky projects. Anyways, if you have any questions about this project or want to talk to me in general, look on my contact page! </p>

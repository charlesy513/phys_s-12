            <p class="py-6">One assignment for week 1 was to create the skeleton of a website. This website will be used to document everything we do. I started with a bootstrap template called "Heroic". I then changed practically everything about it, from the color scheme to the text. The only thing I kept was the format. This format was great because it allowed me to organize my documentation in a way that is easy both for a viewer and me. <br><br>I currently have four ideas for my final project. These are listed below: <br><br><strong>An automated robot that gets me water:</strong><br>This robot will be activated with one click of a button. When someone is watching television or busy in general, getting up is not fun. With this robot, nobody needs to move. The robot can get itself to the refrigerator and snatch a drink. This idea is pretty straightforward: some sensors, motors, and an arm. The hard part will be determining what in the refrigerator is the water.<br><br><strong>An underwater drone:</strong><br>I have always wanted one of these, but they are expensive. Water is usually murky in ponds or lakes. There are two steps to making this drone. 1) Creating a drone that can traverse the water. 2) Be able to see terrain through murky water. As long as the drone is denser than the water (which will be easy), a motor can spin blades in the middle of the drone that lifts the drone up. Blades will also propel the drone forward/backward. To defeat murky water, a powerful headlight is required. There may also need to be some sonar. These images then go to your phone, which also controls the drone. Here a video that inspired me: </p>

            <p><strong>A car that can go up stairs:</strong><br>Anything with wheels has one major problem: it cannot use the stairs. For my final project, I want to create a vehicle that can traverse stairs with ease. I have had some experience making R/C vehicles thanks to robotics; however, arduino (C++)  is a programming language I am unfamiliar with. I hope making this robot will strengthen my understanding of arduino. I still need to prototype a design for this idea.<br><br><br></p>

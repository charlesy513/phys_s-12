            <p class="py-6">Time to build a machine! The homework for week 10 was to make a machine that is controlled from a computer or phone, using at least one stepper motor.<br><br>I started by assembling the slider using the instructions on the week ten website. Then, I decided to make a constant timer that incorporates the slider. This way, I can keep track of time easily, and I would be aware of wasting time.<br><br>The first thought in my mind was to create a capacitance sensor. There would be one copper plate on the slider and one copper plate in a fixed position. Every couple of minutes, the slider would move across and trigger a sound representing an alarm.<br><br>To start off, I created the circuit for this system.<br></p>

            <p class="py-6"><br>I used a buzzer to make the sound.<br></p>
            <p class="py-6">I next wrote the code for the setup. Everything went surprisingly easily, and there were no hitch-ups. The code moves the slider in one direction. Since the bottom of the slider has a copper plate and the ground also has one, once the slider reaches one side, the buzzer will play a sound depending on the capacitance value. The slider then moves back to the original position and waits for a certain amount of time.<br></p>

            <p class="py-6"><br>Unfortunately, my motors all seemed to break, and I was unable to fix them. I tried the original code and reset the board, but the motor continued to hum without moving. Seeing no other choice, I recorded what the slider was suppose to do:<br></p>

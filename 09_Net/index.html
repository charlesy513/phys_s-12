            <p class="py-6">The homework for week 9 is the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Control a board from a local wireless network.</li>
                <li>Program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet.</li>
            </ul><br></p>
            <p class="py-6">The two assignments are related, so I decided I would use the information from the internet to control the board.<br><br>The project I had in mind involved APIs and some other coding. I started with a sketch that we went over in class. This sketch pulled information from the national weather service. Right away, I changed the URL from the national weather service to RapidAPI, where I can pull information from the stock market. <br><br>It took a lot of time for me to figure out how to incorporate APIs that were not from the national weather service. I needed to add a header, and I had no idea how to do it. After some research, I ran across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65619359/how-to-add-headers-to-http-request-in-arduino-ide">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65619359/how-to-add-headers-to-http-request-in-arduino-ide</a>, which taught me how to enter the API key and host. Once I was able to pull the information from the stock market, everything else was a piece of cake. Here was the code I had:</p>

            <p class="py-6"><br>I needed only to pull the current stock price from the entire document. That's when I incorporated the ArdunioJson library that lets me cherrypick data.<br><br>The first time I ran the code, there was a lack of memory. After some research, I found out this error meant I needed to allocate more bytes for the program to run. I changed 10,000 bytes to 100,000 bytes. After I did that,  everything worked fine.</p>

            <p class="py-6"><br>Next, I need to use the data extracted to control the board to do something. I decided to make a servo spin depending on the output of the current stock price of Tesla. I downloaded the esp32servo library for this.<br><br>The code is the following:</p>
            <iframe src=https://create.arduino.cc/editor/charlesy513/9fab56df-80bd-4f45-9419-bc8526f9a16c/preview?embed style="height:510px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>
            <p class="py-6"><br>If the value of the current stock price is above what it was 10 seconds ago, the servo will move to a certain angle. The same happens if the current stock price is under what it was 10 seconds ago.<br><br>Below is a video of this epic stock predictor in action:</p>

            <p class="py-6"><br>As you can see, as the price of the stocks went down, the predictor told me exactly what to do. The exact message? "If you invent, you lose more money."</p>

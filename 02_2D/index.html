            <p class="py-6">The assignment for week 2 is to follow a tutorial and then assemble some components. I had some really basic knowledge of Fusion 360 but to to strengthen my understanding, I first watched these youtube videos:</p>
            <div class="">
                <iframe width="520" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVFYrBClkPc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>These videos taught me how to make shapes other than rectangles and circles. I now realize the lack of unique shapes in all my previous Fusion designs. I messed around a little bit and ended up these masterpieces:</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing1.png" style="width:35%" alt="a random figure">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing2.png" style="width:35%" alt="another one">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>Now, it was time to model something. I first want to model something relatively easy so I can get the hang of Fusion 360. That's why I chose to model a key and doorknob. I used my caliper to measure the length of everything on the key, and then I made a sketch.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing.jpg" style="width:45%" alt="standard key">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing3.png" style="width:45%" alt="key designed in fusion">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>This process was surprisingly complicated. Because the key has angled sides, it was hard to measure certain lengths with the calipers. I had to use lengths I was able to measure to calculate other lengths. I incorporated construction lines to make a job a little easier. Even so, some side lengths were estimated. I also did not model the teeth and notches of the key because they were almost impossible to measure.<br><br>After finally finishing the sketch, I extruded it and used fillets to smoothen out all the edges.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing4.png" style="width:45%" alt="key in fusion">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing5.png" style="width:45%" alt="key with fillets in fusion">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>I then started to make the doorknob. Making it was a lot easier than making the key because my doorknob is basically a cylinder with fillets. I started with a circle sketch, extruded it, and placed fillets on the edges of the circle.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing6.png" style="width:45%" alt="key and doorknob">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing7.png" style="width:45%" alt="key and filleted doorknob">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>To create the doorknob hole where the key will enter, I first sketched a rectangle that was the same as the cross-section of the key on the front side of the filleted cylinder. Then I extruded inward, cutting the inside of the cylinder. Finally, I created a triangle sketch on the wall of the cut and extruded it. The interior of the cylinder is now the same size as the key. I used the align feature and selected two planes and a snap point. The key and the doorknob fit perfectly with a sweet-looking animation.</p>

                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing11.png" style="width:25%" alt="sketch on doorknob">

            <p class="py-6"><br>After completing this first project, I felt confident in my skills in Fusion. I decided to take on a more challenging project: modeling my drone. As it turns out, modeling my drone was EXTREMELY difficult. There were so many rounded edges and curves. I decided to start with the battery. <br></p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion1.jpg" style="width:30%" alt="drone body">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusionthing2.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="drone battery">
            </div>
            <p><br>I had to create three components: the body, the underbody, and the hat. Each component took me more than two hours because of all the little details that existed. For the body, I started with a standard rectangle and then customized it with connecting lines. I then trimmed the unnecessary lines and extruded them.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion3.png" style="width:40%" alt="3D modeling of drone">
            </div>
            <p><br>For the underbody, I created a sketch on the bottom of the body and then made the weird shapes necessary. After extruding these shapes, the general form of the battery started to become apparent.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion4.png" style="width:40%" alt="3D modeling of drone">
            </div>
            <p><br>By far the most challenging part to model of the battery was the hat. It was curved on the top and had so many angles. To start, I sketched a side view and then extruded it. Next, to fit the body to the hat, I cut out a piece of the hat so the body can fit nicely.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion5.png" style="width:25%" alt="3D modeling of drone">

            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>Below is how these three parts combine to create a battery:</p>
            <iframe src="https://students19308.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcfefe8c7dd2ec6e9fc?mode=embed" width="1240" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p class="py-6"><br>By the time I finished the battery, I had realized there was no possible way to model the entire drone. So instead, I decided to model a quarter of the drone; this way, I could see how the battery fitted to the drone without modeling the entire thing.<br><br>I started with a base. The base included some calculations because there were so many angles.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion9.png" style="width:40%" alt="3D modeling of drone">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>I then had to create a sketch on the side of the base so that there could be angles on all three axes.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion10.png" style="width:40%" alt="3D modeling of drone">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion11.png" style="width:40%" alt="3D modeling of drone">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>The next step was the most important. I had to hollow out the body I just created so that the battery could fit. To do this, I had to measure/calculate every length. Because the battery was such a weird shape, the process required more sketches.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="../images/week 2/fusion12.png" style="width:40%" alt="3D modeling of drone">
            </div>
            <p class="py-6"><br>Finally, after 10+ hours of designing, I was able to put the two parts together. Below are the stls' of the two parts and also the actual model of the finished product.</p>
